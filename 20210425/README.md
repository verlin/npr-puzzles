This program was written to solve the weekly challenge for the [NPR Sunday Puzzle for April 25, 2021](https://www.npr.org/2021/04/25/990473656/sunday-puzzle-2-part-puzzles). The goal was to think of the name of a famous person in the news, subject to the constraints given. The solution is a brute force algorithm implemented in Perl, and is simple in both idea and execution. Basically, I further constrained the search area of the puzzle to simply the possible last names for the person, given the constraints, then ran Bing News searches against every possiblty, sorted the output by file size. Out of the 10,000 possibilities, the last name for the solution was in the first 50 files, and of course, the first name was in the news articles linked within the file. The code took about an hour to run on a Macbook Pro 2018 with a 50mbps broadband link. You can see from the comments where I foolishly started attacking this problem with the longer first name.
